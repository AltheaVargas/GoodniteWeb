						Goodnite reserves the right to refuse service and invalidate the warranty when the sleep set, even if defective, is in an unsanitary condition (due to blood or bodily fluid stains or soiling, infestation or other abuse), when the sleep set has evidence of damage from liquid penetration, cleaning or the use of cleaning fluids, or whenever the product failure is caused by factors other than defective workmanship or materials.<br><br>

Allowing the sleep set to be in an unsanitary condition may damage the product and invalidate the warranty. For the health and safety of anyone who would be required to dispose of, or otherwise handle, the sleep set, Goodnite may refuse to inspect such products to assess whether covered by the warranty, in which case, Goodnite reserves the right to deny warranty coverage.<br><br>

The use of cleaning fluids may damage the fabric and materials in your mattress. Allowing water or other liquids to penetrate your mattress may damage the layers of upholstery, causing materials to compress. Either of these situations may result in damage that will invalidate your warranty.<br><br>

Goodnite reserves the right to deny warranty coverage if the sleep set exhibits stains or soiling of unknown origin or nature and it appears to Goodnite, in good faith that the sleep set may be in an unsanitary condition or may have been damaged by liquid penetration or other abuse.<br><br>

This warranty is given by the Goodnite manufacturer. Please retain proof of purchase to validate warranty coverage.<br><br>

Note: Goodnite warranty service is only available in Malaysia.
